When a new Futurama episode comes out after a 10 year hiatus,
how can the Arr-family help you not miss this major event?

# Connections

Pretty simple, connect Sonarr, Radarr etc to your favourite application!

Many options are provided out of the box like Twitter,
Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, Synology, Plex, ...

<!--more-->

If your "thing" is not supported, there is also the option for
executing a [custom script](https://wiki.servarr.com/sonarr/custom-scripts)
or using a WebHook.

There are multiple [triggers](https://wiki.servarr.com/sonarr/settings#connections) for sending a notification.
The most useful is probably:

**On Import** - {Formerly Known as On Download} Be notified when episodes/movies are successfully imported.


## Slack

One of the predefined Connections. The only thing you really need to configure is the Slack WebHook.  
Which looks like this:

```sh
https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
```

Follow their [official instructions](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks):

- [Create An App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
- Features > Incoming Webhooks
    - Activate Incoming Webhooks
    - Add New Webhook to Workspace
    - Copy the url!

**What can you expect**:

Something like this:  
For movies you often even get a poster picture etc!

## Discord

- Setup your own Discord server
- Add your pirate text channel
- Open your server Settings
- Server Settings > Integrations
    - Create Webhook
    - Pick a cool icon etc
    - Copy Webhook URL
    - Save Changes


**What can you expect**:

A much better integration compared to Slack for sure!

For **Plex** there is a dedicated option available.
