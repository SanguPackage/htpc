By now, there are so many containers, who can remember all those funky names/urls/ports.  
The solution is, obviously, to add even more containers!

<!--more-->


# Launchers

A web page where you add tiles for all your docker containers and open them with a single click.
The basic launchers (ex: Minimux) are not much more than a pretty bookmarks site for your containers (or anything else really).
The more advanced ones (ex: Organizr) aggregate information from the other containers so that for some common
functionality you don't even have to leave your launcher at all.


## TL&amp;DR

You probably want to pick one of these three:

- **Heimdall**: Simple bookmarks with some small integrations
- **Homarr**: Simple bookmarks with deeper integrations: a built-in calendar, healthchecks etc
- **Organizr**: If you want the ultimate dashboard and are willing to spend time on it

They know all your favourite containers and are pre-configured with icons/ports for easy setup.  
Integrations are something like showing coming-up shows/movies, the current download speed, active downloads and more.




## Heimdall

![Heimdall Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blog-images/Home Media Center-Heimdall-Logo.png "Heimdall Logo"){: style="float: left; margin-right: 16px"}

{% include github-stars.html url="linuxserver/Heimdall" desc="An Application dashboard and launcher" %}

The [one I went with](https://heimdall.site/). Definitely more feature rich compared to Muximux:

- Multiple users, authentication and multiple dashboards (called "Tags")
- Shows the project logo of all containers mentioned in this post
- Has API integration to show some dynamic data on the tiles for some containers (called "Enhanced apps")
  - Ombi: How many pending requests
  - Transmission: Current Upload/Download speeds
  - Sonarr/Radarr: Missing / Download Queue counts
- Drag & Drop UI, set your own background, optional Google search field
- Open apps in the same or in a new tab

{% include post/image.html file="Home Media Center-Heimdall-Screenshot.jpg" alt="" title="" desc="Heimdall" maxWidth="500px" %}


**Disclaimer**:  
While it works pretty well overall, editing an existing tile can be challenging at times.




## Homarr

![Homarr Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blog-images/Homarr-Logo.png "Homarr Logo"){: style="float: left; margin-right: 16px; width: 50px"}

{% include github-stars.html url="ajnart/homarr" desc="Customizable home page to interact with your Docker containers (e.g. Sonarr/Radarr)" %}


[Homarr](https://homarr.dev/): One of the new *Arr kids on the block, with mobile support.  
Initial setup felt like work but if you enter the name of a known container (ex: Jellyfin, Transmission, ...) it will auto-fill in the details like Heimdall does.

Some notable features why you may want to go with Homarr instead of Heimdall:

- Calendar: Show coming up shows/movies in a calendar widget
- Docker: Start/Stop containers, Pin a running container to the dashboard
- Customizations: Light/Dark themes, background image, dashboard icon size, or just inject custom CSS


{% include post/image.html file="Homarr-Dashboard.png" alt="" title="" desc="Homarr Dashboard with calendar, ping, search, Transmission and docker integrations" maxWidth="500px" %}

{% include post/image.html file="Homarr-Settings.png" alt="" title="" desc="The Settings in Homarr" maxWidth="350px" %}



## Muximux

{% include github-stars.html url="mescon/Muximux" desc="A lightweight way to manage your HTPC" %}

The simplest, most lightweight launcher. Has a small header with your most used apps and launches them
in an iframe. Pretty slick, works well, the settings UI is perhaps a bit lacking.

{% include post/image.html file="Home Media Center-MixuMux-Screenshot.png" alt="" title="" desc="Muximux" maxWidth="500px" %}





## Organizr

{% include github-stars.html url="causefx/Organizr" desc="HTPC/Homelab Services Organizer" %}

Even more feature rich, Organizr gives you unified dashboard(s) for all your containers.
Very good integration with Plex.

- Smooth UI, many customization options
- Deep integration
  - Sonarr/Radarr calendars
  - Ombi requests
  - Media Server activity
  - [Monitor](https://github.com/Monitorr/Monitorr) healthchecks
  - ...


**Disclaimer**:  
I spent some time trying to get this to work and got a few things setup but eventually gave up.
You can create that one complete dashboard, but it's gonna take some time setting it up!



## HTPC-Manager

{% include github-stars.html url="styxit/HTPC-Manager" desc="A fully responsive interface to manage all your favorite software on your Htpc." %}

Works best with XBMC, Usenet & Sick Beard / Couchpotato. So not a good match for our Jellyfin, Sonarr / Radarr setup.



# Docker Infrastructure

<!-- TODO: Add vault, duplicati, ... -->
<!-- If this becomes larger, probably best to move it to a separate article? -->

This section is a work in progress ðŸ˜ƒ But you definitely want:

{% include github-stars.html url="portainer/portainer" desc="Portainer to manage all those docker containers..." %}
{% include github-stars.html url="containrrr/watchtower" desc="Automatically update your containers to the latest versions" %}
